# Generative-AI-Using-Image-Generating-Module-from-Hugging-Face

Technologies Used:
Python: Primary programming language.
Hugging Face Transformers: For leveraging pre-trained image generation models.
Pyngrok: To expose the local Flask application to the web.
Flask: Web framework for serving the application.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the front-end user interface.
Key Features:
Image Generation:

Users can input prompts to generate images using Hugging Face's pre-trained models.
Real-time image generation based on user inputs.
User Interface:

A simple and intuitive interface where users can enter prompts and view generated images.
Dynamic updating of the interface to show new images as they are generated.
Local Web Server Exposure:

Use of Pyngrok to make the local Flask server accessible over the internet.
Provides a public URL for easy access and sharing.
How It Works:
Backend Development:

Flask handles routing, user inputs, and communication with the Hugging Face API.
Python scripts interact with the Hugging Face model to generate images based on user prompts.
Image Generation:

Users input text prompts through the web interface.
Flask processes the inputs and sends them to the Hugging Face API.
The API returns generated images, which are then displayed to the user.
Exposing the Local Server:

Pyngrok creates a secure tunnel to the local Flask server.
Provides a public URL, allowing remote users to access the application.
Front-end Development:

HTML/CSS for structuring and styling the web interface.
JavaScript for handling user inputs and dynamically updating the displayed images.
